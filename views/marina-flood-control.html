        Marina Barrage is part of a comprehensive flood control 
        scheme to alleviate flooding in the low-lying areas in the city 
        such as Chinatown, Boat Quay, Jalan Besar and Geylang. 
        During heavy rain, the series of nine crest gates at the dam 
        are activated to release excess stormwater into the sea 
        when the tide is low. In the case of high tide, giant pumps 
        can drain excess stormwater into the sea.
